# C Systems Programming
*The repository provides information and resources for a systems programming course offered by CMU (Carnegie Mellon University). The course uses two mandatory books: "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective" and "The C Programming Language". The course website and labs are linked, as well as extra material and a course schedule. The repository also includes resources on C programming, including Stanford engineering lectures, GCC's implementation of C99 features, and bit-hacking resources.*

## Systems Programming CMU
### Manditory Books
- https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Systems-Programmers-Perspective-Edition/dp/013409266X : **CMU Systems Programming**
- https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628/ : **K&R Enough said**

### Systems Programming webpage 
- (this has everything you need concering the labs errata extra course material)
**root page for book**
- http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/home.html
**all of the labs (you do these exercises at the end of each section in the book)**
- http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/labs.html
>Some of the extraordinary labs here are the bomb lab which teaches reverse engineering. The attack lab is the buffer overflow lab that will guide you through modern x86 exploitation. Including ROP, there's also a Heap Lab and Shell lab where you write a linux shell, a Proxy Lab, which has you write a multi-threaded network program in C (you learn a ton in all of these), and many others. 

### Course Outline (Follow this material with the book).
